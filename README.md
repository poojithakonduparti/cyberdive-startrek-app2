## Objective
Build an Employee Information Survey Form using Amplify and React where the employees of Startrek-Flyhigh can easily enter their information to [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/#:~:text=Amazon%20DynamoDB%20is%20a%20fully,data%20import%20and%20export%20tools.). This app should be able to provide access to creating employee details using [AppSync]


## Abstract
The task involves building a decoupled architecture for the Flyhigh-Startrek Employee Survey Portal:

- Single Page Application for Employees 
- Fill the form with valid details and click on Submit
- Auto Update the Employee Table in **real time** on the Admin Portal when a new employee record is added from Employee Survey Portal

## Project Components

### AppSync

AWS AppSync is a fully managed service that simplifies the development of real-time data-driven applications by providing an easy way to securely integrate with multiple data sources and automatically scale as the application grows. For the purpose of this project, AppSync has been implemented to perform the **create** mutation to the database.
> Create Employee Data


The Admin Portal gets updated without **refresh** whenever a new employee record is inserted through the Employee Survey Portal into the table. This is made possible by using AppSync APIs to truly ensure decoupling between two applications.


### DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability, making it ideal for applications that require low latency data access at any scale. DynamoDB has been used in this project to store employee data like ID, Name, Phone Number, Email, Job Title, Department Name, etc.

The Employee Information is gathered and will be stored in the Database with a *primary key** - ID. Any operations in the Admin Portal will require this ID to perform update or delete functionalities.


### Amplify
AWS Amplify is a development platform that provides a set of tools and services for building scalable and secure cloud-powered web and mobile applications, enabling developers to focus on the front-end development and easily integrate with backend services such as authentication, storage, and APIs. 
The Form for the users has been built using Amplify UI Libraries. This takes the inputs from the user and also provides integration to AppSync and DynamoDB.

### React
React is a powerful JavaScript library designed for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. By breaking down the UI into reusable components, React enables developers to build complex applications in a modular and efficient way, with faster rendering and better performance compared to traditional approaches. Its popularity has made it one of the most widely used front-end development tools in the industry.

React has been used widely in the project to build the frontend. The form styles and components of the application have been built by leveraging React.

## How to run the application locally

1. Clone the repo to get all the source code on your machine

2. Within the cyberdive-startrek-app2/my-amplify-project/  folder, go to your terminal and run

                  npm install
        
Note: This will add all the required dependencies and modules to the project in your local

3. Execute the React Web App by running the command in your terminal

                 npm run start

Note: You can ensure that multiple apps can run on different ports simultaneously by going to the `package.json` file in your local and setting the `script` has `PORT=<your-desired-port> react-scripts-start` specified in it.
Alternatively,
In case the ports specified in the `package.json` are already taken, you will have to say yes to the prompt for running it on a different port. You can continue running it on a different port by typing yes.

5. Access application through the port you just opened!

## How to run tests

Backend testing for the API has been setup, frontend testing has been done through extensive validation checks on the frontend. In order to run the tests, go to your terminal and run the following command

                  npm run test
